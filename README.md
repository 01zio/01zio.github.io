## Welcome to My World

##
I am a boy form 240, and I think there are many people I will know in the future.

##
Today is March 20, 2022. I build this website.
##
This is my first code:


Syntax highlighted code block

public class ArrayMax{
public static void main(String[] args){
  
  int [] arr = {1,4,6,7,87,-43,0};
  int Max = arr[0];
  for (int i = 1; i<arr.length ; i++){
  if(Max<arr[i]){
  Max = arr[i];
    }
  }
 System.out.println("arr数组中最大的数为：")；
 }
}
